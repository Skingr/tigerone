# tiger one

## Getting Started

Execute
```
npm install

```

Create a .env file at the root directory. The variable within should be:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Sawyers API-key no brackets]
DATABASE_URL=[Contact Isaac for the key]
CANVAS_API_KEY=[follow below directions]
```
Crucial that we include the .env so we dont publish our key.
